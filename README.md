This project processes SMPS (Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer) data to identify the three common aerosol modes—nuclei, Aitken, and accumulation—via Gaussian fitting. The script segments time-series data, averages over intervals, fits a 3-mode Gaussian model (gauss3), and classifies fitted components based on size thresholds. It outputs geometric means, mode percentages, and fitting metrics to support aerosol-cloud interaction studies.
